Locale Reloader
==============

This is just a simple plugin created to Rails >= 2.2, that allow you to easily
reload your locales without restart all the rails instances. This is easy as
follows:

Install
=======

ruby script/console git://github.com/xjunior/locale-reloader.git

Requirements
============

 * Rails >= 2.2
 * UNIX based system (yeah, but who uses windows for production, right?)

Example
=======

With your rails application started (this is more efective in production mode,
since your locales are automaticaly reloaded in development), and the locale
reloader plugin loaded, just type:

rake locales:reload

You'll see the status of the reload like this:

$ rake locales:reload
(in /home/chjunior/workspace/test)
Reloading 5179          OK
